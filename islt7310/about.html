        <p>
            My name is <b>Dustin Doubet</b>. I'm originally from central Illinois but now live in Missouri. 
            I am currently a senior IT student at the University of Missouri <em>graduating</em> in <em>May 2022</em>.
            My favorite fields are design and coding. I've been told that these two fields are weird together but I find them both interesting and intertwined. 
            They are both useful in programing and designing video games and this is one of my passions. I currently work at Menard's dealing with lumber outside in the yard. 
            I spend most of my time outside school and work playing video games such as, Old School Runescape, Valheim, and Path of Exile.
