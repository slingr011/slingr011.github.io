        <h2 class="header">Reflection of my Career and Academics</h2>
        <p class = "RewriteP1">
            I graduated from Illini Bluffs High School in Glasford, Il in 2011. From there I started learning about machine maintenance at Illinois Central College through ATS (Advanced Technical Services). 
            I worked for them in Caterpillar plants until 2012 then I moved to being a machine operator at Caterpillar until I was laid off in 2013. In 2014, I started working for Keystone Steel and Wire 
            running a machine that made fencing. After 2 years doing that, I transferred to the Rod mill at Keystone and did Quality Control for most of my time there, until I hurt my back in 2018. 
            This prompted me to go back to school.
        </p>
        <p class = "RewriteP2">
            I started off by finishing my 2-year degree in general education at Spoon River College and eventually transferred to the University of Missouri in 2019. At the University of Missouri, 
            I studied Information Technology and learned programming and graphical design. I learned how to program in C, C++, Python, and HTML. I learned how to design many different things such as posters,
            advertisements, and videos.
        </p>
        <p class = "RewriteP3">
            Currently I am working at Mendards as an Outside Lumber Yard employee. I stock outside shelves and help guests. I enjoy this job so I am going to continue working here after graduation until I can find a
            decent job in the IT field.
        </p>
        <p class ="RewriteP4">
            My career goals after I finish school are find an Information Technology job, work hard, and learn as much as I can. Understanding how something works fascinates me and has always kept me interested 
            in programing.
