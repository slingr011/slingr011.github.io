     <p>My name is Dustin Doubet. I'm originally from central Illinois but now live in Missouri.
     I am currently a senior IT student at the University of Missouri graduating in May 2022. 
     My favorite fields are design and coding. I've been told that these two fields are weird together but I find them both interesting and intertwined. 
     They are both useful in programing and designing video games and this is one of my passions. I currently work at Menard's dealing with lumber outside in the yard. 
     I spend most of my time outside school and work playing video games such as, Old School Runescape, Valheim, and Path of Exile.</p>
